![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a20b8843-df58-4c12-bf4f-0da51468efc2)


This project demonstrates a basic AI-driven approach to music creation, exploring how AI agents can assist in generating musical ideas and compositions.  It's inspired by the blog post [Build a Simple AI DAW](https://blog.jonaylor.com/build-a-simple-ai-daw).

## Description

This repository provides a foundational example of integrating a simple AI agent with a basic framework for a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).  The core idea is to use AI to generate musical elements, which can then be manipulated and arranged within the DAW environment. This is a starting point for exploring more advanced AI techniques in music composition and production.

## Features

*   Basic AI agent for music generation.
*   Simple framework for interacting with the agent.
*   Demonstrates the fundamental principles of AI-assisted music creation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   uv (preferred package manager)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jonaylor89/AudioAgent.git
    cd AudioAgent
    ```

2.  Install dependencies using `uv` and run :
